"""Source health transition alerts.

Sends a Discord alert to the admin/guild channel when a scraping source
changes health state (healthy -> degraded, or degraded -> healthy), plus a
re-escalation every ESCALATE_EVERY consecutive failures so a long outage
isn't silent after the first alert.

Grounded in real probe data (HTTP status / consecutive_failures) — no
guessing. Anti-spam: only fires on a genuine transition or an escalation
milestone, never on every cron tick.
