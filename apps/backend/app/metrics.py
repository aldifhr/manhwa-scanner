"""Lightweight process-level metrics (no external deps).

Counters are incremented from hot paths (cron, dispatch, errors) and
exposed via GET /api/metrics (JSON, cron+monitor auth) alongside DB counts.
Prometheus metrics (GET /metrics, open) are the canonical scrape endpoint
for infrastructure; this module is for lightweight JSON debugging.

M1 FIX: Counters are now bounded — old counter names are pruned when
count exceeds MAX_COUNTERS to prevent unbounded memory growth.
